 AutoCAD project at Mott MacDonald:

      1.  Project Title
   - Infrastructure Development of Industrial Estates in Tripura.

       2.    Project Description 
     This project involves the design and development of industrial estates in Tripura using AutoCAD. The estates include Dharmanagar, Bodhjungnagar, R.K. Nagar, Sarasima, and Dewanpasa. It was undertaken during my internship at Mott MacDonald in March 2024. The aim of the project was to create detailed layout designs and optimize the infrastructure planning of these estates._

     3.     Project Objective
     - The objective of this project was to assist in the development of infrastructure for industrial estates by producing accurate AutoCAD designs. The focus was on layout planning, road networks, drainage systems, and space optimization.

    4.  Project Features
     - Designs of multiple industrial estates
     - Road and drainage system planning
     - Space allocation for industries
     - Optimization of land use and infrastructure alignment
  
      5. Technologies Used
      AutoCAD (for design and drafting)

      6. Usage
     The AutoCAD drawings provided can be used for reference in infrastructure development projects, or to understand the layout design of the estates. Simply open the `.dwg` files in AutoCAD to view the designs.

      7. Project Status
     This project was completed during my internship at Mott MacDonald and is fully functional as a reference for infrastructure design.
