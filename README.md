 AutoCAD project at Mott MacDonald:

      Project Title
Infrastructure Development of Industrial Estates in Tripura

Project Description
This project focuses on the design and development of industrial estates in Tripura, using AutoCAD for detailed layout creation. The estates include Dharmanagar, Bodhjungnagar, R.K. Nagar, Sarasima, and Dewanpasa. It was completed during my internship at Mott MacDonald in March 2024. The primary goal was to create detailed layout designs and optimize the infrastructure planning of these estates.

Project Objective
The objective of this project was to support the development of infrastructure for industrial estates by producing accurate AutoCAD designs. The focus areas were layout planning, road networks, drainage systems, and space optimization to maximize land use efficiency.

Project Features

Comprehensive designs for multiple industrial estates
Planning of road and drainage systems
Efficient space allocation for industrial purposes
Optimization of land use and infrastructure alignment
Technologies Used

AutoCAD (for design and drafting)
Usage
The AutoCAD drawings can be used as references for future infrastructure development projects or to gain insights into the layout designs of industrial estates. The .dwg files can be opened in AutoCAD to view and analyze the designs.

Project Status
This project was successfully completed during my internship at Mott MacDonald and serves as a functional reference for industrial estate infrastructure design.
